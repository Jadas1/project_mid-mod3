        <p>
          The Peace & Senerity app assists people with everyday locations throughout
          the city where you can unwind and relax. Want to read a book under the trees
          with the smell and feel of nature? Would you like to go to a free concert
          where you can sit back and enjoy the music? How about taking the kids to a
          free event and have a family cookout at the same time away from the noise of
          the city? No matter the reason, the Peace & Senerity app helps you locate
          the best parks and do all of these things and many more. If you want something
          to do and are undecided, this application is just the thing you need.
